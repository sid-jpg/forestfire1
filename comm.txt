do the following steps for us on this project:
1. if the location points to sea, ocean or any water body, then it should show a message showing "water body detected" with appropriate message. 
2. if the location points to any city, dessert, building or any landsacpes where there are no forests or many trees, then display appropriate message.
3. in step 1 & 2, do not show the probability of fire risk
4. in the probability risk panel, also show the name of city on which it is being calculated
5. develop a flutter app which uses this website or this mechanism and an alert can be sent to the mobile throught that app regarding the fire risk, a pop up notification.
6. figure out how to connect the app and this website, like a centralised system
7. make the app with attractive and interactive UI.
8. and an admin panel whhich will be used to mount what kind of model, and changing the model, pushing high alert messages etc
8. also help me in deploying this website in vercel
